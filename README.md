# MinecraftAutofish
A simple python script to automatically fish in minecraft.
To use it, simply use the zip file as your resource pack. This changes the color of the text for the fishing subtitles, allowing the python script to automatically fish for you.

Make sure to enable subtitles.

This script assumes that you are on a 1920*1080 screen.
